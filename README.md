# Gate Management System

The Gate Management System is a project designed to demonstrate good practices of object-oriented programming and design, as well as the use of data structures in both Java and Rust. This project compares how these concepts are handled in Java versus the considerations of the ownership system in Rust and the use of macros to reduce boilerplate code.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming and design in both Java and Rust.
- **Data Structures**: Compares the implementation and handling of data structures in Java and Rust.
- **Test-Driven Design**: Both implementations are developed using Test-Driven Design (TDD) to ensure reliability and maintainability.
